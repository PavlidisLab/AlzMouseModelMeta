adj_cell_pop: rankings are MGP adjusted


for all probes: the background probes are not filtered (with low expressed probes/genes) which may not be representitive when the input are hippocampal samples (more brain-expressed genes than all gene of the organism)

2016-02-23: GSE50521 were still in 4 groups

2016-03-07: GSE50521 in 2 groups, and low expression probes are removed, background are based on the meta or jack files with low exp probes removed.


ermineJ background must have geneID (same as geneSymbol), geneSymbol, geneNames, GOterms
