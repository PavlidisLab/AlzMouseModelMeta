# only 8 upregulated genes were listed(out of 39+8, including 5 downregulated genes in tg2576)			
#fig1(B) Overview of significantly up-regulated genes common to both Tg2576 and APPPS1 mice. No genes were significantly down-regulated that were common to both Tg2576 and APPPS1 mice			
#Differentially expressed genes were found with LIMMA (http://www.bioconductor.org) by a moderated t-test 18. Significance was assessed at p < 0.001 or false 			
#discovery rate-adjusted pFDR < 0.05 19.
