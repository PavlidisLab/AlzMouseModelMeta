# updated 2017-03-06 late																						
# updated 2016-04-21 -gemma and CEL files â€“ limma DEA																						
# this is the data for limma_DEA.R and explore_data_general.R																						
# 1. reqired columns for explore_data_general.R 'eeName','platform_id',  'subset', 'subset_by', 'keep_subset', 'outlier', 'outlier_to_rm' 																						
# 2. the table file must contain the following columns for limma_DEA.R (outlier must be removed before limma_DEA.R)																						
#      'eeName': GSE_id, e.g. GSE1234																						
#      'platform_id': e.g. GPL1261																						
#      'subset': 'yes' indicate that samples needed to be subsetted, if no subset is needed, leave it blank																						
#      'subset_by': if subset is 'yes', fill in this column of which factor needs to be subsetted 																						
#                    and separated by '; '(with a space) if multiple factors are required to be subsetted. e.g. 'OrganismPart; Timepoint'																						
#      'keep_subset': indicate the levels of a factor or multiple factors to keep for analysis. order is the same as order in 'subset_by'																						
#                    column. e.g. 'c('Hippocampus'); c('6_months', '15_months')'																						
#      'batch_corrected': 'yes' to retrieve batch corrected expression matrix, 'no' otherwise																						
#      'factors': factors to be used in the limma model, e.g. c('Genotype', 'Batch')																						
#      'factor_levels': specify factor levels which update the baseline level in the limma model, sep by '; ', 																						
#																						
# seperator: '; ' (there's a space after ;) if multiple factors are in the subset_by, each keep_subset are seperated by '; '																						
# gender_record: from the literature, gender xist: based on the Xist gene																						
# subset: further subset the samples (maybe remove treatment)																						
# batch corrected: to use the array data with combat batch corrected (results can be compared to the non-bacth corrected)
