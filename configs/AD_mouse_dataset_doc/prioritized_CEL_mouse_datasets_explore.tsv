# updated 2016-04-21 for CEL files - analysis mode, only AD mice, updated 2016-09-19																			
# this is the data for explore_data_general.R (not for limma)																			
# 1. reqired columns for explore_data_general.R: eeName,platform_id,  subset, subset_by, keep_subset, outlier, outlier_to_rm 																			
#      eeName: GSE_id, e.g. GSE1234																			
#      platform_id: e.g. GPL1261																			
#      subset: yes indicate that samples needed to be subsetted, if no subset is needed, leave it blank																			
#      subset_by: if subset is yes, fill in this column of which factor needs to be subsetted 																			
#                    and separated by ; (with a space) if multiple factors are required to be subsetted. e.g. OrganismPart; Timepoint																			
#      keep_subset: indicate the levels of a factor or multiple factors to keep for analysis. order is the same as order in subset_by																			
#                    column. e.g. c(Hippocampus); c(6_months, 15_months)																			
#      batch_corrected: yes to retrieve batch corrected expression matrix, no otherwise																			
#																			
# seperator: ;  (theres a space after ;) if multiple factors are in the subset_by, each keep_subset are seperated by ; 																			
# gender_record: from the literature, gender xist: based on the Xist gene																			
# subset: further subset the samples (maybe remove treatment)																			
# batch corrected: to use the array data with combat batch corrected (results can be compared to the non-bacth corrected)																			
# Notes: problem with GSE26600
